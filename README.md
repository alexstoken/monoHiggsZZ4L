## Analysis of Higgs to ZZ to 4 lepton decay channel in search of dark matter @ CMS Experiment 
#### Summer 2017, Bari, Italy

### Full text of my contributions to CMS Analysis Note 16-328
[Cuts and Limits for HZZ4l Exotics](https://github.com/alexstoken/monoHiggsZZ4L/blob/master/AN_latex/AN_Limits_Stoken.pdf)

Contribution is divided into 4 main sections:
1. VBF analysis using a Bayesian Neural Network to seperate VBF events from other Higgs events, and calculate the best cut to seperate these events
2. Kinematic plot stacks for the monoHiggs analysis (included in the repo is the plotting program as well as the most recent plots produced using miniA0D trees)
3. Limit plots and data for Z' and Z'Baryonic Dark Matter models (included is the plotting program as well as the most recent plots)
4. My contributions to the CMS analysis note on the subject

### Usage
To produce new kinematic stacks and limit plots, use `makeLimitPlots.py`, `makePlotStacks.py`, and `plot_VBF.py` with data produced from tools in [Dustin Burn's repo](https://github.com/dburns7/MonoHiggsToZZ4Leptons).
