# monoHiggsZZ4L
Analysis of Higgs to ZZ to 4 lepton decay channel in search of dark matter done in summer 2017 in Bari (CMS experiment) 

Use with Dustin Burn's repo https://github.com/dburns7/MonoHiggsToZZ4Leptons, which has also been forked on my profile. 

Analysis is divided into 4 main sections:
1. VBF analysis using a Bayesian Neural Network to seperate VBF events from other Higgs events, and calculate the best cut to seperate these events
2. Kinematic plot stacks for the monoHiggs analysis (included in the repo is the plotting program as well as the most recent plots produced using miniA0D trees
3. Limit plots and data for Z' and Z'Baryonic Dark Matter models (included is the plotting program as well as the most recent plots)
4. My contributions to the CMS analysis note on the subject, in Latex form

An additional directory contains the discrimiants used in the various portions of the analysis
